- experiment with taking the avg std per frequency from the dataset preprocessing and using that to initialize starter noise
  when sampling (after using schedule.add_noise with timestep = max_timestep)

- remove separable resnets and adjustable conv size, clean up code

- optimize deployment code for a bigger experiment on lambda cloud
  - read/write flac instead of raw using torchaudio
  - upload dataset to HF and support asynchronous push to hub for model / checkpoint saves

** less important **
- investigate v-prediction with min_snr
- investigate input perturbation
- investigate input scaling (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10972.pdf)
- investigate separable attention for training a custom vae
