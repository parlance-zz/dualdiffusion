- optimize deployment code for a bigger experiment on lambda cloud
  - read/write flac instead of raw using torchaudio
  - upload dataset to HF and support asynchronous push to hub for model / checkpoint saves

** less important **
- linear beats cos^2 schedule in the long run with v-prediction
- v-prediction beats epsilon (which seems almost broken), whereas it seems sample beats v-prediction on cos^2
- testing sample with linear schedule in progress (31)
- investigate min_snr and input perturbation with winning objective and schedule
- investigate dropout
- investigate input scaling (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10972.pdf)
- add validation to train script, investigate using something like fid for audio
- investigate separable attention for training a custom vae
- investigate doubling the crop width and sample rate for a 512x512 model
