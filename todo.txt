- experiment with taking the avg std per frequency from the dataset preprocessing and using that to initialize starter noise
  when sampling (after using schedule.add_noise with timestep = max_timestep)
- add reverse separable attention order for upblocks in new_lgdiffusion3 code
    - add the tracking offset so it ALWAYS alternates time <-> frequency attention layers on every block and every layer
    - remove failed experiments like positional coding and separable resnets
- optimize deployment code for a bigger experiment on lambda cloud
  - read/write flac instead of raw using torchaudio
  - upload dataset to HF and support asynchronous push to hub for model / checkpoint saves

** less important **
- investigate v-prediction with min_snr
- investigate input perturbation
- investigate input scaling (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10972.pdf)
